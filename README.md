# Sort-Comprehesive-
Create the following arrays of random integers.
Array	Number of random integers
a	100
b	1000
c	10,000
d	100,000
e	1,000,000
I don't care about variable names. I do care that five arrays exist and have the specified number of random integers. Please declare these arrays however best suits your program.

5.2.	User the following code to measure the time a given sort needs to sort the array.
randomizeArray(a);
long startTime = System.nanoTime();
sortArray(a);
long endTime = System.nanoTime();
long duration = (endTime - startTime) / 1000l;
5.3.	Measure the time it takes for: insertionSort, selectionSort, mergeSort, and quickSort each to sort the arrays. 
5.3.a. Your arrays will be sorted after you call the sort routines! Make sure to reinitialize the arrays with random values before each sort.
5.4.	Output the time it takes for the sorts to run on each of the arrays. You will have to increase the size of the console pane to capture all the output.
Your program output could look like the listing on the right.
Your running times will probably be different than these. 
Please do a better job with the snipping tool than I did.
Optional challenge: put the output in a nicely formatted table.
